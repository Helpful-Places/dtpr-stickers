## Deploying

First make sure you have the firebase cli (https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/)

Then build for production and deploy
`yarn build`

`firebase deploy`


The build step bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance, and locates it in the `build` folder.
